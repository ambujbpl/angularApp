  },
  "Features": {
    "Feature1": "Two Way Data-Binding- AngularJS' two-way data-binding handles the synchronization between the DOM and the model, and vice versa.",
    "Feature2": "Templates- The HTML templates are parsed by the browser into the DOM. The DOM then becomes the input to the AngularJS compiler. AngularJS traverses the DOM template for rendering instructions, which are called directives.",
    "Feature3": "MVC- The MVC or Model-View-Controller pattern means a lot of different things to different people. AngularJS does not implement MVC in the traditional sense, but rather something closer to MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).",
    "Feature4": "Dependency Injection- AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection subsystem that helps the developer by making the application easier to develop, understand, and test.",
    "Feature5": "Directives- Directives can be used to create custom HTML tags that serve as new, custom widgets. They can also be used to 'decorate' elements with behavior and manipulate DOM attributes in interesting ways.",
    "Feature6": "Testing- The AngularJS team feels very strongly that any code written in JavaScript needs to come with a strong set of tests. They have designed AngularJS with testability in mind, so that it makes testing your AngularJS applications as easy as possible."
